Hi there!

This is SeleniumWebDriver Hybrid project in Java. This project is testing the http://tutorialsninja.com/demo/ application and its
functionalities.

I selected couple of functionalities:
- Login
- Register
- Search

To start this project you need to have Java version 11 or higher, Maven installed in your machine and some Java Editior if you want to 
start there or if you want to start this project in command prompt then you need to position yourself in the project directory where pom.xml 
is presented and open there command promp and run command mvn test. After that project will start and when all tests are finished you will 
get Extent Report in HTML located in ExtentReports folder under project directory.
